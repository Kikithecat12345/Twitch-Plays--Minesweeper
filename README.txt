You may re upload the files inside the reupload folder in any noncommercial way as long as this reference and the link on the index page is kept and you do not weaken these conditions for anyone downloading the version you have modified.
You may also reupload files from this directory under the same conditions. If they either stay in the context of this full unaltered project or if you want to host them somewhere if you add a clear note and link to the original like in reupload/index.html to them.
However the files in the reupload directory are fully functional on their own. While this directory uses some outdated scripts causing incorrect links.

Also note that this game is heavily inspired by the game Minesweeper which is owned by Microsoft
